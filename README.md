# Landing Page Project - The Odin Project, Foundation

## What is This?

This is the solution to the [Landing Page challenge](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page) from The Odin Project. I built this project using the [Zenful Template](https://github.com/sydalwedaie/zenful-template), which I created to speed up my practice projects like this one. It uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) for the build process, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling, and [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) as a minimal templating engine.

## What I Learned

The main objective of this project is learning to use Flexbox for layouts. Specifically, I learned that after setting the flex-direction to column and horizontal centering with align-items, the size of the container is adjusted to the size of the content. That is why I needed to specify the width on the child element to force it to the desired width.
