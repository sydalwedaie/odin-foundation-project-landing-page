# Landing Page Project - The Odin Project, Foundation

## What is This?

This is the solution to the [Landing Page challenge](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page) from The Odin Project. I created this project using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/).

**Note:** I am also the author of the [Zenful Template](https://github.com/sydalwedaie/zenful-template). I created it to practice using TailwindCSS for begener projects like this one.

## What I Learned

The main objective of this project is learning to use Flexbox for layouts. Specifically, I learned that after setting the flex-direction to column and horizontal centering with align-items, the size of the container is adjusted to the size of the content. That is why I needed to specify the width on the child element to force it to the desired width.
